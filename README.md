# About
BaconBot is a simple bot for Discord that uses discord.js. 

## Note
Just a warning, this was my _first_ bot, and it's pretty messy. It's probably not even the best learning material. At **some** point I'll get around to cleaning it up, but you should check out some of my other bots like [SharpBot](https://github.com/Rayzr522/SharpBot) or [RayzrDev Bot](https://github.com/Rayzr522/RayzrDevBot) (that's the one for my Discord server, you can check it out in action by clicking the image down below).
